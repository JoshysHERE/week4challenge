// AS A coding boot camp student
//I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
//SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

// GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
//HEN I click the start button
//THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
//WHEN I answer a question
//THEN I am presented with another question
//WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
//THEN time is subtracted from the clock
//WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
//THEN the game is over
//WHEN the game is over
//THEN I can save my initials and my score
